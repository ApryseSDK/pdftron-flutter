# 1.0.1 - October 19, 2021
* Updated the Android plugin and widget [(#128)](https://github.com/PDFTron/pdftron-flutter/issues/128):
    * The plugin now supports [Flutter's new embedding engine](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/plugin-api-migration).
    * The widget now uses [hybrid composition](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-views?tab=ios-platform-views-objective-c-tab#hybrid-composition). This update fixes issues such as: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/58273
    and in regards to stability, places the widget on parity with the plugin.
* Added new APIs for:
    * opening UI lists e.g `openAnnotationList()` 
    * traversing to different pages e.g. `gotoPreviousPage()`
    * configuring the viewer e.g. `config.defaultEraserType`

See [the commit history](https://github.com/PDFTron/pdftron-flutter/commits/master) for the full list of new APIs.
