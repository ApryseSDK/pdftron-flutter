- Updated the Android plugin and widget ([#128](https://github.com/PDFTron/pdftron-flutter/issues/128)):
  - The plugin now supports [Flutter's new embedding engine](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/plugin-api-migration).
  - The widget now uses [hybrid composition](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-views?tab=ios-platform-views-objective-c-tab#hybrid-composition). This update fixes issues such as: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/58273
    and in regards to stability, places the widget on parity with the plugin.
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect viewer configurations to be placed on the iOS plugin and widget ([#138](https://github.com/PDFTron/pdftron-flutter/pull/138) and [#143](https://github.com/PDFTron/pdftron-flutter/pull/143)).
- Added new APIs for:
  - opening UI lists e.g. `openAnnotationList()`
  - traversing to different pages e.g. `gotoPreviousPage()`
  - configuring the viewer e.g. `config.defaultEraserType`

See [the commit history](https://github.com/PDFTron/pdftron-flutter/commits/publish-prep) for the full list of new APIs.
